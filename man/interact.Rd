\title{Calculate interaction statistics for user-specified variables}
\usage{
interact(object, varnames = NULL, nullmods = NULL, k = 10, plot = TRUE,
  penalty.par.val = "lambda.1se", col = c("yellow", "blue"),
  ylab = "Interaction strength", parallel = FALSE,
  main = "Interaction test statistics", legend = TRUE, verbose = FALSE,
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{\link{pre}}.}

\item{varnames}{character vector. Names of variables for which interaction
statistics should be calculated. If \code{NULL}, interaction statistics for
all predictor variables with non-zeor coefficients will be calculated (which
may take a long time).}

\item{nullmods}{object with bootstrapped null interaction models, resulting
from application of \code{bsnullinteract}.}

\item{k}{integer. Calculating interaction test statistics is a computationally
intensive, so  calculations are split up in several parts to prevent memory
allocation errors. If a memory allocation error still occurs, increase k.}

\item{plot}{logical Should interaction statistics be plotted?}

\item{penalty.par.val}{character. Which value of the penalty parameter
criterion should be used? The value yielding minimum cv error
(\code{"lambda.min"}) or penalty parameter yielding error within 1 standard
error of minimum cv error ("\code{lambda.1se}")? Alternatively, a numeric 
value may be specified, corresponding to one of the values of lambda in the 
sequence used by glmnet, for which estimated cv error can be inspected by 
running \code{object$glmnet.fit} and \code{plot(object$glmnet.fit)}.}

\item{col}{character vector of length two. Color for plotting bars used. Only
used when \code{plot = TRUE}. Only first element of vector is used if
\code{nullmods = NULL}.}

\item{ylab}{character string. Label to be used for plotting y-axis.}

\item{parallel}{logical. Should parallel foreach be used? Must register
parallel beforehand, such as doMC or others.}

\item{main}{character. Main title for the bar plot.}

\item{legend}{logical. Should a legend be plotted in the top right corner of the
barplot?}

\item{verbose}{logical. Should progress information be printed to the
command line?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to \code{barplot}.}
}
\value{
If nullmods is not specified, the function returns the interaction
test statistic. If nullmods is specified, the function returns a list,
with elements \code{$H}, which is the test statistic of the interaction
strength, and \code{$nullH}, which is a vector of test statistics of the
interaction in each of the bootstrapped null interaction models. In the barplot,
yellow is used for plotting the interaction test statistic. When applicable,
blue is used for the mean in the bootstrapped null models.
}
\description{
\code{interact} calculates test statistics for assessing the strength of
interactions between the input variable(s) specified, and all other input
variables.
}
\details{
Can be computationally intensive, especially when nullmods is specified,
in which case setting \verb{parallel = TRUE} may improve speed.

 set.seed(42)
 airq.ens <- pre(Ozone ~ ., data=airquality[complete.cases(airquality),])
 interact(airq.ens, c("Temp", "Wind", "Solar.R"))}
